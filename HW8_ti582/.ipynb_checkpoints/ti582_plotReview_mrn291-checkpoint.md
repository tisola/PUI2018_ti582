#### Plot Review

Overall, I think this is a very clear plot that is well designed and easy to interpret. Good work!

##### Clarity

The plot is easy to read and the chosen features are unambiguous. One thing that might have made it more clear is to have a legend on the map itself, although you do clearly explain what the markers and shading are in the figure description.

##### Aesthetic

I think the map respects the "remove to improve" philosophy which really focuses the eye on the relationship between the location of senior centers and the slow zones. I appreciate that you didn't try and introduce any other features through an additional shading or symbolism in the PUMAs themselves. Additionally, I think the colors you chose were well considered, particularly to represent the slow zone.  I checked the colors for compliance and they do well with the different kinds of color-blindness.

##### Honesty

I think the map does a fairly good job of representing this relationship, although if the data were available, one thing that might demonstrate the relationship more explicitly would be to size the dots by the number of seniors the center serves.  I know there are many senior centers that have pretty small annual usage and others that serve many more people--it might be that it looks like there are a lot of centers in a particular place outside of a slow zone, but they may not serve as many seniors as a senior center by itself in a slow zone.
