# Plot review

In general this plot is nicely put together, easy to read without getting lost or distracted by unnecessary factors. Color selection makes it easy to identify the different elements and the type of marker chosen helps add more information to the map. Although the figure has a caption as part of the markdown file, it would have helped to have the caption be part of the figure. Also, it would have been helpful to have a legend in the figure so people looking at the plot can understand what the blue dots and red areas represent. Finally, for people who are not familiar with this data, it would be interesting to better explain in the caption what Slow Zones are.
