# PUI 2018 HW #10

I am using my HW extension for this HW assignment.

This is the README file for my HW10 assignment. I worked on the entirety of the HW10 assignment alone.

## Assignment 1

Refer to my "HW10_A1_TI.ipynb" file. The beginning part of my notebook is taken mainly from Professor Bianco's skeleton notebook 'LRtest_lab.ipynb'. I have used mostly the same variable names. Then, I did the section "Do it yourself as homework" by myself as per the instructions.  

## Assignment 2

Refer to my "HW10_A2_TI.ipynb" file. I have followed Professor Bianco's skeleton notebook, "building_nrg_instructions.ipynb".
