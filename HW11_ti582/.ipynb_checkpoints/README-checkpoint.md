# PUI 2018 HW #11

This is the README file for my HW11 assignment. I worked on the entirety of HW11 alone.

## Assignment 1

Refer to my "HW11_A1_TI.ipynb" file. I have followed Professor Bianco's skeleton notebook, "subway_timeseries_instructions2.ipynb". 

## Assignment 2

Refer to my "HW11_A2_TI.ipynb" file. I have incorporated as much of amm1209's and mrn291's reviews into my updated plot as I could. I was unable to incorporate the suggestion to size the Senior Centers markers by the size of the Senior Centers since I do not have that data.
